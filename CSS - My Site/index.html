              <h2>Hello!</h2>
              <p>I'm an aspiring full stack web developer based out of Tampa, FL. My passions include producing clean, simple, and modernized websites. I enjoy being outdoors in the sun and love 80's cop movies, 90's chick flicks, and anything that makes me laugh! I also enjoy reading and expanding my taste in music.</p>

            <h3>Listening & Problem Solving</h3>
            <p>Often overlooked as skills, I have mastered listening with intention and am able to understand your vision. This allows me to better problem solve and create designs that will resonate with who you are and where you want your business to go!</p>
